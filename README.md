# esp32-memory-game
This project is a memory game where i wired leds to certain gpios on my esp32. The code hosts a webserver and the leds flash in a sequence that starts at one led. every iteration adds a new random led and the previous ones are the same. the user then has the chance to match the sequence with buttons on the hosted webpage.
